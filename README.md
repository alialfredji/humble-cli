# Humble CLI

## Install:

**HumbleCLI** is distributed as a GitHub repository of _bash scripts_ that are linked to your `/usr/local/bin` folder to be globally available.

> It is pretty much the same approach that _Hombebrew_ had chosen, you can trust us :-)

Run the following command to automagically come the repository and install HumbleCLI.

**On your Mac:**

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcopeg/humble-cli/master/remote-setup.sh)
```

**On your Ubuntu Server:**

```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcopeg/humble-cli/master/remote-setup.sh)
```

## Update:

```
