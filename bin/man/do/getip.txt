GETIP
=====

Show the current Network IP assigned to your machine.
(currently tested only on Mac OSX)

NOTE: If you have more than one network interface connected it will show just
the first one.

Your current Network IP is also available as environment variable
to your `.env` or `docker-compose` files:

   ```
   API_URL=http://$HUMBLE_HOST_IP:300
   ```
