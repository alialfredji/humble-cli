FS-IMPORT
=========

Imports files from the host file system to a service's volume.

    ```
    humble utils fs-import /host/path storage://internal/volume
    ```

If your source path is properly formatted you can skip the last option.
A proper formatted path looks like that:

    ```
    storage___internal---volume
    ```
