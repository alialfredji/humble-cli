FS-EXPORT
=========

It exports files from a service volume to the host file system:

```
humble utils fs-export storage://var/logs
-> $PROJECT_CWD/storage___var---logs
```

the exported folder name is set so to be compatible with `fs-import`
script so to automatically match the target service/path.

you can give an optional absolute path so to fine control where
the export will end up:

```
humble utils fs-export storage://var/logs /host/target/folder
```
