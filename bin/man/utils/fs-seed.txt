FS-SEED
=======

Restore a compressed archive into a service volume.

    ```
    humble utils fs-seed storage___data---folders___20161104.122651.tar.gz
    ```

It will read the archive from `data/backup`
(where `data/backup` is defined in the environment variable `$BACKUP_ROOT`)
and will seed `storage://data/folders`

You can give a custom archive path, even an absolute path, and use the
optional target parameter to tell Humble which service/volume to seed:

    ```
    humble utils fs-seed /backups/images.tar.gz storage://var/www/images
    ```
